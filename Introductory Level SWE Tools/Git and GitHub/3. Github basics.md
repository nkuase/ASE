GitHub Basics for Newbie Developers

---

## GitHub vs Git: The Difference

- **Git** (Local):

```bash
git add, git commit, git branch, git merge
```

- **GitHub** (Remote):

```bash
Push, Pull, Pull Requests, Issues, Teams, Actions
```

---

### GitHub is

- Git + Social Coding + Project Management.
- Your portfolio management.
- **Your web server!**
  - YOUR_GITHUB_ID.github.io

---

### Remote Management

- `origin` - Your fork/repository
- Many GitHub-related commands.

```bash
# View current remotes
git remote -v

# Add a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

---

**Use GUI Tools (Recommended)**

- In most cases, VSC GitHub features and extensions will be enough for daily work.
- Git Tower will make GitHub usage simple and easy.
- However, in some cases, you must use CLI tools; so, you need to understand how to use Git CLI commands.

---

## Git Fetch

- Downloads **new commits/branches/tags** from remote (e.g., `origin`)
- **Does not** modify your working files or current branch
- Lets you review before integrating

```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/main --oneline --graph --decorate
```

---

## Git Pull = Fetch + Merge

- First fetches from remote
- Then merges into your current branch
- Updates your working files

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

---

## Git Push

- Uploads your local commits to the remote
- Makes your changes available to others
- Fails if remote has new commits you donâ€™t have (use pull/rebase first)

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### Use Cases

- Preview remote changes safely â†’ git fetch then inspect
- Sync your branch with remote â†’ git pull
- Publish your work â†’ git push

**Tip:** You can use `git pull --rebase` to keep history linear (after git fetch).

---

## GitHub Organizations

When we develop software in a team using GitHub, we create an organizational repository.

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture â†’ **Your organizations**

---

3. Click the "New organization" button.
4. Choose the Free organization plan.
5. Choose organization name and contact email.
6. Complete setup.

---

### Teams

In the organization, we can make teams.

1. On the Tab: Teams â†’ New Team
2. Invite your team members using their GitHub ID.
3. Set the role in the organization.

- Member/Owner
- Teams

---

## Fork

Instead of cloning a repository, you can fork the repository.

- Your copy on GitHub
- Can modify freely
- Mainly used for open source contributions

---

When we don't use a fork:

- We *make a branch*, make a change, and make a pull request (PR).

When we use fork:

- We *fork* the open source project, make changes, and make a pull request (PR).

---

## Pull Requests (PR)

Create PR

- From branch to branch (usually to `main`)
- Can be within the same repo in an organization/team
- Cross-repository PRs for open source

---

PR Components

- Title and description
- Reviewers and assignees
- Labels and milestones
- Linked issues

---

### PR Creation Best Practices

Title Format: [Type] Brief description

```txt
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve login redirect issue
docs: Update API documentation
```

---

Description Template (Example)

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Changes Made
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Manual testing completed

## Related Issues
Closes #123
```

---

### Code Review Process

Before merging the PR, team members should do the code review.

**Reviewer Actions:**

- **Comment**: General feedback
- **Suggest changes**: Inline code suggestions
- **Approve**: Ready to merge
- **Request changes**: Needs fixes

---

#### GitHub Tools for PRs

- We can use the `gh` command line tools.

<style scoped>
code { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

```bash
# Create PR from command line
gh pr create --title "Add feature" --body "Description"
# List PRs
gh pr list
# Check out a PR locally
gh pr checkout 123
# Review PR
gh pr review --approve
gh pr review --request-changes --body "Needs tests". 
# Merge PR
gh pr merge 123 --squash
```

---

- We can use the VSC Pull Request extension.
- We can even use the GitHub.com site for code review.
- The focus is the `process` of doing code review, not the tool for the process.

---

## GitHub Projects

- Using GitHub projects, we can manage projects.
- Project Types:
  - **Table View**: Spreadsheet-like organization
  - **Board View**: Kanban-style workflow

---

### Project Management

- Milestones:
  - Group issues by release/sprint
  - Track progress toward goals
  - Set due dates
- Automation:
  - Auto-move issues when PR created
  - Auto-close when PR merged
  - Assign based on labels

---

### Issues Management

**Issue Types:**

- **Bug reports**: Something broken
- **Feature requests**: New functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve docs
- **Questions**: Need help/clarification

**Issue Templates:**

- Repository Settings â†’ Features â†’ Issues â†’ Set up templates
- Standardizes bug reports and feature requests

---

#### Issue Reporting

Labels:

```txt
Priority: high, medium, low
Type: bug, enhancement, documentation
Status: needs-review, in-progress, blocked
Difficulty: good-first-issue, help-wanted
```

---

### Workflow Example

```txt
ðŸ“‹ Backlog â†’ ðŸ”„ In Progress â†’ ðŸ‘€ Review â†’ âœ… Done
```

---

### Linking Issues and PRs

**In commit messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "Fix login bug Closes #123"
```

In PR descriptions:

```markdown
Fixes #123
Resolves #456
Closes #789
```

---

Benefits of GitHub Project:

- Automatic issue closure
- Traceability between code and requirements
- Better project tracking

---

## GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

**Modern application uses CI/CD**

- CI (Continuous Integration)
- CD (Continuous Development)
  
- GitHub supports CI/DC using Actions
- GitHub provides a virtual computer to process the requests in the workflow.

---

Workflow Example: .github/workflows/ci.yml

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm run deploy
```

---

In this example:

- **Triggers:** Push, PR, schedule, manual
- **Use cases:** Testing, deployment, notifications

---

## GitHub Pages

**Free static website hosting** directly from your GitHub repository

Perfect for:

- Personal portfolios
- Project documentation
- Course websites
- Blog sites (using Hugo or similar)

---

### Types of GitHub Pages Sites

> **Important:** Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username!

1. User/Organization Pages

- Repository name: `username.github.io`
- URL: `https://username.github.io`
- One per GitHub account

---

2. Project Pages

- Repository name: `any-name`
- URL: `https://username.github.io/any-name`
- Unlimited per account

---

### Creating a User Site

Step 1: Create a Repository

1. Go to **GitHub.com** and sign in
2. Click **"New repository"** (green button)
3. Repository name: **`yourusername.github.io`**
4. Make it **Public**

---

Create an `index.html` and other files, but you can add any static files.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
</body>
</html>
```

---

### Create Any Repository

1. Create a **new repository** with any name (e.g., `my-project`)
2. Make it **Public**
3. Create a directory (i.e., `\docs`) to publish its content.

---

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on **GitHub.com**
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** section

---

4. Under **"Source"**, select:

- **Deploy from a branch**
- Branch: **main**
- Folder: **/docs**

5. Click **"Save"**

---

### Deploy Project Site

1. Add static files in the directory.
2. **Your project site will be live at:**
`https://username.github.io/my-project`

---

### Best Practices

- File Organization (Example)

```txt
yourusername.github.io/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ about.html          # About page
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css       # Stylesheets
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ script.js       # JavaScript files
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logo.png        # Images
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Repository documentation
```

---

#### Tips

- Always use lowercase filenames
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Include a `404.html` for error pages
- Optimize images for the web
- Test locally before pushing

---

#### Static Site Generator

- GitHub supports Jekyll, written in Ruby.
- In this course, we use Hugo, written in Go.
  - We use Markdown to make its content.
