# Core Skills for ASE Students  

**Essential Tools for Modern App Development**

---

## Introductory Level

In 200-level ASE courses, students are expected to have basic familiarity with:

- **Tools**
- **Documentation Formats**
- **Programming Languages**

---

### ðŸ›  Tools

- **VSCode** â€“ Code editing and extensions  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration  
- **Linux CLI Tools** â€“ Command-line efficiency and automation  

---

### ðŸ“„ Documentation Formats

- **Markdown** â€“ Lightweight text formatting for docs and READMEs  
  - **Marp** - Presentation
- **JSON** â€“ Structured data for configuration and APIs  
- **YAML** â€“ Human-readable configuration and data serialization  

---

### ðŸ’» Programming Languages

- **Java / JVM** â€“ Standard for software engineering  
- **Python** â€“ AI, data science, and automation  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Web development and interactivity

### Donâ€™t Worry

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 28pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

- Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re not familiar with these tools **yet**  
- Jump in and start using them for your projects  
- Theyâ€™re just problem-solving tools  
- With practice, youâ€™ll master these â€” and more â€” faster than you think

---

### However

- Learn to **install** and **use** these tools on your own  
- Independent mastery of tools is essential for a software engineering career  
- ASE courses wonâ€™t cover tools in depth, but will provide basic instructions and guidelines  

---

### The Good News

- Many high-quality YouTube tutorials are available  
- AI/LLM tools are often helpful (but not always accurate due to hallucinations)  
- Share error messages with AI tools â€” they can guide you toward solutions

## Tools for ASE Courses

> **Notice:** This list is a guideline â€” specific tools may vary by instructor or other factors.  
> **Remember:** ASE students are expected to master all these tools (and more) before entering real-world software engineering.
