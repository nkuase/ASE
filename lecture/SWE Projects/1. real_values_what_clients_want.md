# Who Are the "Clients"?

- **High-Level Officials:** CEO, CTO  
- **Your Direct Managers and Tech Leads:** most likely your immediate audience  
- **Product Owners & Sales Team:** define and sell the vision  
- **Real Clients:** the ones who actually pay for your product

---

## You Are a Professional Painkiller

Instead of thinking of yourself as a developer, think of yourself as a professional who **solves** a client's pain.

Your real job is to sell: **UP ReST**

- **U**nderstanding
- **P**eace of Mind
- Risk **Re**duction
- **S**tatus Enhancement
- **T**ime Recovery

---

## 1. **U**nderstanding from Problem Translation

Software Engineer as the Translator

- **Understand First:** Clients want you to get what they’re *really* after.  
- **Avoid Blind Spots:** Developers often jump to solutions too quickly.  
- **See the Bigger Picture:** Many “technical” issues are actually business or organizational.  
- **Your Action:** Ask for the origin story—how it began, who’s involved, why is this important, and the context—*before* giving solutions.

---

## 2. **P**eace of Mind from Reliability

**Clients are buying reliability.** They want to hand off the problem and trust it will be solved without drama.

- **Real Need:** Clients want confidence you’ll stay with them, handle issues smoothly, and not vanish mid-project.  
- **Why It Matters:** An unreliable developer creates serious business risk.  
- **Value Multiplier:** Reliability is often worth **10x** more than code quality alone.  

---

## 3. Risk **Re**duction from Certainty

**Clients are afraid of looking silly.** If the project fails, their reputation is on the line. Your job is to be the safe choice.

- **Real Need:** Clients worry, “If this fails, will I look bad?”  
- **Insurance Premium:** They’ll gladly pay more to reduce the chance of failure.  
- **Modern Tactic:** Use AI to build quick prototypes, lowering risk and reframing the conversation.  

---

## 4. **S**tatus Enhancement from Success

**People buy with emotion, then justify with logic.** Appeal to their self-interest.

- **Real Need:** Clients ask, “Will this make me look smart to my boss, board, or peers?”  
- **Political Reality:** Internal politics often outweigh technical details.  
- **Positioning Power:** Win by being the **safe choice**, not the cheapest option.  

---

## 5. **T**ime Recovery from Freedom

**Give your client their life back.** This isn't just about efficiency metrics; it's about reducing their mental load.

- **Real Need:** Clients wonder, “How much of my time and energy will this save me?”  
- **Hidden Cost:** They want freedom from the management burden of dealing with difficult or unreliable partners.

## Worst Case Scenario

- Saying "everything will be OK."
- Do not do anything to make meaningful progress.
- Do not share the progress.
- Giving wrong information about progress to bosses or co-workers possibly with white lies.
- Pointing fingers to others.

---

## Best Case Scenario

- Do something to make sure "everything is OK."
- Make meanginful progress little by little everyday.
- Share any progress you make.
- Giving correct information no matter how it hurts.
- Thinking what went wrong and how could I prevent this from happening.

---

## Recommendations

- Set milestones when you set a deadline.
- Start early to finish early.
- Identify what you don't know as quickly as possible.
- Don't think or complaint before you finish something.
- Make (any) decision and start working, you can change the decision anytime later.
