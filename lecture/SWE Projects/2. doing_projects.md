# Project Related Rules

---

## Rumsfeld's Law

> We don't know what we don't know (Unknown unknowns) until we know what we don't know (Known Unknowns).

1. **Start Early:** Begin quickly to reveal what you don’t know.  
2. **Prototype First:** Test feasibility before the MVP to ensure you’re solving the right problem.  
3. **Seek Clarity:** Work hard to gain a clear vision as a problem solver.  

---

## Effective first, efficient later

> Planning the fastest trip to New York is useless if you really need to be in Los Angeles.  

1. **Focus on Impact:** Solve the right problem before worrying about speed or cost.  
2. **Validate Direction:** Early solutions may be rough, but they prove value and feasibility.  
3. **Refine for Efficiency:** Once effectiveness is clear, streamline and optimize.  
4. **Avoid Premature Optimization:** The first goal is to ship the MVP, not perfect it.

---

## Make it a Game, Enjoy Small Victories

> Big achievements are just a collection of small wins stacked together.  

1. **Gamify the Work:** Treat challenges like levels to beat.  
2. **Celebrate Progress:** Every small win builds momentum.  
3. **Stay Motivated:** Fun fuels persistence through obstacles.  
4. **Use All Course Materials:** Treat homework, exams, and quizzes as opportunities to practice problem-solving, not burdens to avoid.  

---

## Make it Work, then Make it Better

> A rough solution that works is more valuable than a perfect one that never ships.  

1. **Start Simple:** Deliver something functional first.  
2. **Prove Value:** Show it solves the problem before refining.  
3. **Iterate Later:** Improve design, speed, and polish after validation.  
4. **Avoid Perfection Trap:** Progress beats endless tweaking.  

---

## Think in Systems, Build the System

> Strong systems outlast quick fixes and scale beyond individual effort.  

1. **Vertical Slice First:** Build the system to deliver end-to-end value instead of isolated layers.  
2. **Sustainable Foundations:** Design systems and processes with growth and change in mind.  
3. **Think Solutions in Systems:** Let solution patterns emerge naturally within the system.  
4. **System as Accelerator:** Once built, the system makes every next project faster and easier.  

---

## System-Driven Processes

> A good system creates processes that run and improve themselves.  

1. **Self-Improving:** The process continuously makes the process better.  
2. **Reduce Mental Burden:** Free people from micromanagement and memory load.  
3. **Consistency:** Ensure reliable results regardless of who executes the task.  
4. **Scalability:** Allow teams to grow without adding complexity.

# Evaluation

---

## Based on Rubrics

- Rubrics check whether you deliver on your promises according to plan.  
- Evaluations are based directly on these rubrics.  
- Focus on progress, clear communication, solid design, and flexible systems—then you’ll earn the points and trust you deserve.  

---

## Three Options on Using Generative AI

> Generative AI is like the invention of fire or electricity—we must use it, but we should use it wisely.  

1. **No AI Use:** Focus on strengthening raw coding skills without assistance.  
2. **AI as Support:** Leverage AI for tests, refactoring, and code improvements to accelerate progress.  
3. **Vibe Coding:** Collaborate with AI to produce impressive results that go beyond what you could achieve alone.  

---

## Low Quality Results will Earn Less

> As professional software engineers, low-quality results are not acceptable.  

1. **Individual Responsibility:** Teammates may support and encourage, but each member is accountable for their own results.  
2. **No Progress Means Low Quality:** Lack of progress damages the team just as much as poor output.  
3. **Objective Evaluation:** Results will be judged professionally by peers and leaders—without emotions.  

---

## Last Minute Sprints Will Earn Less

> Wasting time and rushing at the last moment is the most dangerous habit for professionals.  

1. **Plan Wisely:** Schedule your time to prevent last-minute crunches.  
2. **Communicate Early:** Share issues immediately with teammates, tech leads, and managers.  
3. **No Compensation:** Fancy results cannot make up for last-minute work—trust may already be broken.  
4. **Respect Deadlines:** Treat the **dead**line as final—set your own target at least one week earlier.  

---

## Project Results Are Your Portfolio

> Add at least two projects to your portfolio after completing an ASE course.  

1. **Prove Capability:** Show real problem-solving skills.  
2. **Stand Out:** Only résumés with portfolios get noticed—keep a one-page version ready.  
3. **Showcase & Promote:** Use GitHub as your hub and highlight projects on LinkedIn.  
4. **Be Proud:** Share both victories and how you overcame failures—your future peers will want to hear about them.

# The Format of Project Progress (Team/Individual Project)

---

## Overall Process (Team)

1. **Progress Pages:** Canvas pages are created for every member and leader for the team project.  
2. **Set Plans:** Each leader and member defines goals, deadlines, and milestones (HW2).  
3. **Update Regularly:** Use the pages to track and update goals and progress on a weekly basis.  
4. **Weekly Presentations:** Team leaders review and discuss progress at the first meeting each week.  

---

## Weekly Presentations (Team)

1. **Leaders Monitor Only:** Team leaders don’t ask for submissions—just check progress pages.  
2. **No Public Call-Outs:** If a member makes no progress, leaders don’t discuss it in presentations.  
3. **Know Your Role:** Non-technical team issues are for managers, not tech leads, to resolve.  
4. **Objective Evaluation:** Leaders and members assess each person fairly and without emotion.  

---

## Celebration Moment

> We will celebrate these milestones, each followed by a presentation.  

1. **Project Kickoff:** Teams set goals, deadlines, and milestones, and upload them to start.  
2. **Prototype Demo:** Celebrate when the prototype is built and presented (if required).  
3. **MVP Launch:** Mark the moment when the minimum viable product is ready.  
4. **Project Completion:** Final celebration when the project is finished.  

---

## Overall Process (Individual Project)

1. **Progress Pages:** Canvas pages are created for every member for the individual project.  
2. **Set Plans:** Each leader and member defines goals, deadlines, and milestones (HW2).  
3. **Update Regularly:** Use the pages to track and update goals and progress on a weekly basis.  
4. **Presentations:** Each team member presents their project in class; if time is limited, presentations may be shortened.

# Presentation

---

## Know your audience

> Explaining everything in technical jargon is like speaking a foreign language to someone who just wants the story.  

1. **Identify Stakeholders:** CEOs, managers, product owners, sales, and real clients all have different needs.  
2. **Tailor Communication:** Adjust depth—big picture for executives, details for developers.  
3. **Focus on Value:** Show how your work impacts business goals, not just technical wins.  
4. **Build Trust:** When people feel understood, they’ll trust your solutions more.

---

## In Your Presentation

> You are an actor—stay natural no matter what happens.  

1. **Irregularities Stand Out:** The audience remembers what breaks the flow.  
2. **Audience First:** Say what they need to hear, not just what you want to share.  
3. **Be Concise:** Keep it short and to the point.  
4. **Add Page Numbers:** Always number your slides for clarity and reference.
