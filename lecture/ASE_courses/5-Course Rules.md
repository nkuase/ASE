## Students Rules

1. Integrity First Rule – Protect Your Integrity

- Integrity is not just for academics; it’s part of who you are.
- Avoid all forms of cheating.
- Be truthful with yourself — if you cut corners, you’ll ultimately undermine your own growth.

2. Two Hats Rule – Learn and Solve

- In ASE courses, you are professional problem solvers; focus on effective and efficient problem solving.
- At the same time, you are students — it’s your job to learn, explore, and improve.

- The professor treats all students equally.
- Any perception of any form of unfairness **must** be addressed immediately for resolution.
