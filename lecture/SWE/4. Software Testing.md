# Software Testing

**The quality assurance that keeps your code working**

---

## Testing: Like Quality Control in Manufacturing

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 22pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

**Real-world analogy:** Car manufacturing

- Every car part is tested before assembly
- Final inspection before it leaves the factory
- Recall if problems are found later

---

**In software:**

- Every function/method should be tested
- Integration testing ensures parts work together
- Bug fixes or any changes trigger retesting
- Before shipping, check if all the requirements are met

---

## Why Testing is Critical

No High-quality code without testing:

- Fixing bugs in production is cheap.
- You can refactor confidently.
- Saves debugging time.

---

- Serves as documentation.
- Enables CI/CD.
- Makes code more maintainable.
- Essential for career growth.
- Prevents embarrassing failures that damage user trust.

---

### Testing is the most efficient way to make high-quality software

- **Prevents costly bugs** – Catch issues early  
- **Builds confidence** – Refactor without fear  
- **Saves time** – Pinpoints failures quickly  
- **Documents behavior** – Shows how code should work  
- **Enables deployment** – Safe, frequent releases  
- **Reduces stress** – No 3 AM crashes  

---

- **Improves maintainability** – Cleaner, modular code  
- **Covers edge cases** – Finds hidden problems  
- **Collaboration** – Shared understanding of behavior  
- **Career Growth** – Professional standard  
- **User Trust** – Prevents failures, protects reputation

## Unit Tests: Testing the Building Blocks

- Testing light switches in a new house
  - Each switch should turn its specific light on/off
  - Test BEFORE connecting all the wiring
  - If one fails, fix it immediately

> Test each function/method individually
> Unit testing is a part of development, not testing.

---

### Unit Testing Benefits

- **Early Bug Detection**
- **Safe Refactoring**
- **Living Documentation**
- **Design Feedback** as Hard-to-test code = bad design

> Write tests as you develop, not after!

---

## Types of Tests: The Testing Pyramid

- **Unit Tests** (Bottom - Most tests)
  - Test individual functions/methods
  - Fast and isolated

- **Integration Tests** (Middle)  
  - Test how modules work together
  - Database + business logic

- **Acceptance Tests** (Top - Fewest tests)
  - Test complete user scenarios
  - Does the whole system work?

---

### Regression Tests (Spanning All Levels)

- Can be unit, integration, or acceptance tests.
- Re-run after every code change, bug fix, or feature addition.
- Focus on previously tested features and known bug fixes.

---

### Test Types Explained

- **Unit Test:** "Does this brick work?"
  - Tests one method/function at a time
- **Regression Test:** "Does the renovated room still work?"
  - Re-run tests after code changes

---

- **Integration Test:** "Do these rooms connect properly?"
  - Tests multiple modules together
- **Acceptance Test:** "Is the customer happy with the house?"
  - Tests complete user requirements

## Unit Test Rules: The Golden Guidelines

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 28pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

1. Test Early, Test Often - Like checking ingredients while cooking
2. Make It Automatic - Set up continuous testing
3. Bug = Update Tests - Fix the bug AND prevent it from recurring
