# Software Architecture

Building the Blueprint for Software Systems

---

## Why Do We Need Software Architecture?

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 26pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

Imagine building a skyscraper without blueprints...

- **No plan** → Workers don't know what to build
- **No coordination** → Electrical, plumbing, structure conflict

---

- **No standards** → Different floors built differently
- **Chaos** → Project fails, building collapses

**Same with software!** Without architecture, code becomes a mess.

---

## What is Software Architecture (SA)?

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.0 !important;}
</style>

1. Software Architecture is about (Three Software Architecture Components)

- Elements
- Interactions of Elements
- Constraints on Elements and interactions

2. Software Architecture provides

- a framework to satisfy requirements
- a basis for software design

### Real-World Analogy: City Planning

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 18pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| City Planning                               | Software Architecture                              |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Buildings** (houses, offices, shops)      | **Components** (modules, classes, services)        |
| **Roads & Infrastructure**                  | **Interfaces & Communication**                     |
| **Zoning Laws** (residential, commercial)   | **Constraints & Design Patterns**                  |
| **Master Plan**                             | **Architectural Framework of Requirements**        |
| **City Requirements** (population, traffic) | **System Requirements** (performance, scalability) |

---

## Key Components of SA

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 19pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

1. **Elements**
   - Modules, components, services, classes
   - Like buildings in a city
2. **Interactions**
   - How components communicate
   - Like roads and utilities connecting buildings
3. **Constraints**
   - Rules and limitations
   - Like building codes and zoning laws

---

## Common SA Patterns

- MVC
- MVVM
- Server/Client
- Other Important Architectures

---

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 27pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

- MVC: Web example
  - Model: data (HTML)
  - View: how the model is presented (CSS)
  - Controller: handles input and updates model/view (JavaScript)
- **Benefits:** Separation of concerns, easier testing, maintainability

---

- MVC: Restaurant Analogy
  - Model (Kitchen) - Prepares food, manages ingredients
  - View (Dining Room) - What customers see and interact with  
  - Controller (Waiter) - Takes orders, coordinates between kitchen and customers

---

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 24pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

- MVVM: Web example
  - **Model:** data (JavaScript objects, API/data layer)
  - **View:** UI display (HTML/CSS)
  - **ViewModel:** connects view and model, handles UI logic and data binding (JavaScript frameworks like Vue, Knockout, Angular)
- **Benefits:** Separation of concerns, easier testing, two-way data binding, maintainability

---

- **Model (Kitchen, mainly food):**
  - Prepares and manages the food
- **View (Dining Room, only view):**
  - What customers see only
- **ViewModel (Manager):**
  - Middleman: takes orders from the dining room, communicates with the kitchen, and updates the dining room when food is ready
  - Handles logic and coordination

---

### Core Concepts

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Aspect       | MVC (Model-View-Controller)      | MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Components   | Model, View, Controller          | Model, View, ViewModel               |
| Main Link    | Controller connects Model & View | ViewModel connects Model & View      |
| Data Binding | Manual, not built-in             | Built-in, supports two-way binding   |
| User Input   | Handled by Controller            | Handled by View, passed to ViewModel |

---

#### Structure & Responsibilities

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 24pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

- **MVC**
  - Controller manages user input and updates Model/View.
  - View is aware of Model.
  - Simpler, best for small to medium projects
- More tight coupling among M,V, and C

---

- **MVVM**
  - ViewModel handles UI logic and data binding (UI component to UI variables).
  - View is *not* directly aware of Model.
  - Suited for complex UIs and larger projects
- Less tight coupling among M,V, and VM

---

#### Testability & Maintenance

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Feature         | MVC                                            | MVVM                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Testability     | Moderate; Controller tightly coupled with View | High; ViewModel easily tested, loosely coupled |
| Maintainability | Good for simple apps                           | Excellent for complex apps                     |
| Code Reuse      | Limited                                        | High, especially ViewModels                    |

---

#### When to Use

- **MVC:**  
  - Simple, smaller projects  
  - When direct data binding is not needed

- **MVVM:**  
  - Large, complex, or data-driven UIs  
  - When maintainability, testability, and two-way data binding are priorities

---

## Client-Server Architecture

- **Divides software into two roles:**  
  - **Client:** Requests services or data  
  - **Server:** Provides services or data

- **How it works:**  
  - Client sends a request over a network  
  - Server processes the request and sends back a response

---

### Key Features

- **Clear separation of roles**
- **Multiple clients** can connect to a single server
- **Standard protocols** (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP) enable communication
- **Scalable and flexible** for many types of applications

---

#### Real-World Analogy

- Like a coffee shop:
  - **Client:** Customer ordering coffee
  - **Server:** Barista making and serving the coffee

---

## Other Important Architectures

- Microservices
- Layered Architecture
- Event-Driven

---

### Microservices

- Food Court analogy: Each restaurant (service) specializes in one thing
  - Pizza Service
  - Noodle Service
  - Burger Service

### Layered Architecture

- Office Building analogy: Each floor has a specific purpose
  - 4F: Presentation
  - 3F: Business Logic
  - 2F: Data Access
  - 1F: Database

### Event-Driven

- Emergency Response analogy: When the fire alarm rings, everyone responds
  - Event → Fire Dept
  - and Ambulance
  - and Police

---

### How to Choose the Right Architecture?

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 18pt !important; line-height: 1.0 !important;}
</style>

Ask These Questions:

1. **Scale:** How many users? (Small app vs. Facebook)
2. **Complexity:** Simple calculator vs. Banking system
3. **Team Size:** Solo developer vs. 100-person team
4. **Performance:** Real-time game vs. Blog website
5. **Maintenance:** Will it change frequently?
6. **Technology:** Web, mobile, desktop, embedded?

---

#### Architecture Decision Example

Building a University Course Management System:

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 16pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Requirement             | Architectural Choice     | Why?                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Web + Mobile access     | **Client-Server**        | Multiple client types  |
| Complex business rules  | **Layered Architecture** | Separation of concerns |
| Real-time notifications | **Event-Driven**         | Instant updates        |
| Different user roles    | **MVC/MVVM**             | Clean UI separation    |

### Key Takeaways

### **Why Architecture Matters:**

- Prevents chaos and technical debt

- Supports scalability and maintenance

### **What Architecture Provides:**

- Blueprint for development
- Framework for decisions
