# Command Line Interface (CLI)

Your Developer Superpower

---

## What is CLI?

<style scoped>
li { font-size: 28pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

A **text-based interface** where you type commands to interact with your computer

- **CLI**: Like texting - precise, quick, can be saved and repeated
- **GUI**: Like phone calls - immediate but harder to remember exact steps

---

## Why CLI?

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)** = **Restaurant**

- Beautiful menus with pictures
- Point and click to order
- Limited to what's on the menu
- Slower for complex orders

---

**CLI (Command Line Interface)** = **Your Own Kitchen**

- Direct access to all ingredients
- Create exactly what you want
- Combine tools in unlimited ways
- Fast once you know the recipes

---

### CLI vs GUI: Created 12 folders

GUI Approach (20+ clicks):

1. Right-click → New Folder → Type name
2. Double-click to enter
3. Right-click → New Folder → Type name
4. Repeat 10 times...

CLI Approach (1 line):

```bash
mkdir -p project/{src,tests,docs,assets}/{js,css,images}
```

## Package Managers: Your Software Assistants

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 23pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Platform | Tool | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **macOS** | `brew` | Install development tools |
| **Windows** | `choco` | Install development tools |
| **Windows** | `WSL2` | Linux CLI |
| **Linux (Ubuntu)** | `apt` | Install development tools |

*For Windows, students can use `choco`, but for development purposes, they need to install `WSL2` and use a Linux system on Windows.*

---

| Programming | Tool | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Node.js** | `npm/npx` | Manage JavaScript packages |
| **Python** | `pip/uv` | Manage Python packages |

*Many applications are deployed as Node.js or Python packages.*

---

## Homebrew (macOS)

- Installation
- Make sure the bin directory is in the path.
  - Apple Silicon: /opt/homebrew/bin/
  - Intel: /usr/local/bin

```bash
/bin/bash -c 
  "$(curl -fsSL 
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

---

Common Commands:

```bash
# Install software
brew install node python git

# Update everything
brew update && brew upgrade

# Search for packages
brew search visual-studio-code

# Install GUI applications
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

---

Other Mac CLI tools

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Tool | Admin Required? | Best Use Case |Learning Curve |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Homebrew** | No | General development | Easy |
| **MacPorts** | Yes | Scientific/Research |  Medium |
| **Fink** | Yes | Debian familiarity | Medium |
| **mas** | No | App Store apps |  Easy |
| **Conda** | No | Data science |  Medium |

*In most cases, Homebrew is enough CLI tools for Mac, but Conda may be needed for data science courses.*

---

## Chocolatey (Windows)

Installation (PowerShell as Admin):

- Chocolatey adds applications to PATH during installation.
- However, sometimes you need to "refresh (refreshenv)" your environment to see the changes.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

refreshenv # refresh
```

---

Common Commands:

```bash
# Install software
choco install nodejs python git
# Update everything
choco upgrade all
# Search for packages
choco search vscode
# Install with GUI
choco install vscode googlechrome firefox
```

---

- Other Windows CLI tools

<style scoped>
table { font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.2 !important;}
</style>

| Tool | Admin Required? | Best Use Case | Learning Curve |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Chocolatey** | Yes | General software | Medium |
| **Winget** | Usually | Official packages | Easy |
| **Scoop** | No | Developer tools | Medium |
| **Ninite** | Yes | Bulk installs | Very Easy |
| **Conda** | No | Data science | Medium |

## CLI Automation

- The Real Power CLI comes from automation
  - We can automate build, execution, document generation, and tests
- Real-World Analogy: Recipe vs. Cooking Show

---

### Manual Work (Cooking Show)

1. Watch step-by-step
2. Repeat every time
3. Easy to make mistakes
4. Takes the same time each time

---

### Automation (Recipe Script)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-project.sh
mkdir $1
cd $1
npm init -y
npm install express
echo "console.log('Hello World!');" > app.js
echo "Project $1 created successfully!"
```

---

### Automation Examples

Daily Developer Tasks:

- setup, deploy, clean, backup, and check the system in one script

```bash
# Setup new project
./setup-project.sh awesome-app
# Deploy to production
git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push origin main
# Clean up old files
find . -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete
# Backup important files
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz src/
# Check system status
ps aux | grep node && df -h && free -m
```

---

## CLI Benefits

- **Speed**
  - Type faster than click
  - One command = many GUI actions

- **Automation**
  - Save and repeat commands
  - Batch operations
  - Scheduled tasks

---

- **Precision**
  - Exact control over parameters
  - No misclicks

- **Scalability**
  - Manage hundreds of files
  - Process large datasets

---

- **Remote Work**
  - SSH into servers
  - Work on headless systems

- **Version Control**
  - Save command history
  - Share scripts with teams

- **Professional Development**
  - Required for DevOps
  - Essential for system administration
